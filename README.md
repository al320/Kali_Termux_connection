# Kali-Phone-SSH Connection
This project provides a simple script that establishes an SSH connection from a Kali Linux machine to an Android phone running Termux.  
This setup allows you to remotely control your phone from your Kali machine, which could be useful for development, file transfers, or basic remote management.

## Features

- Connect to an Android phone from Kali using SSH.
- Automates the setup process to make connecting easier.
- Bypasses the initial SSH fingerprint prompt for convenience.

## Prerequisites

- Termux App installed on your Android device.
- Kali Linux (or any Linux system with SSH installed).
- Both devices (Kali and your phone) should be connected to the same network.
- OpenSSH server installed and running on Kali.
